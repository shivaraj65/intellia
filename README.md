# 🧠 Intellia Widgets

**Intellia Widgets** is a modular Web3 widget system built on top of [UniversalEverything.io](https://universaleverything.io) — a decentralized profile space powered by the [LUKSO](https://lukso.network) blockchain. Think of it as Facebook widgets meets on-chain identity.

With Intellia, users can enhance their Universal Everything profiles with interactive, on-chain widgets like polls, highlights, and reviews — fully powered by smart contracts, wallet-based interactions, and signed transactions.

- Public display on user profiles
- Useful for community sentiment or social notes

### 🌟 Reviews

Ask questions and let others rate and review their experience, product, or interaction.

## 🔗 How It Works

1. Users browse [UniversalEverything.io](https://universaleverything.io) profiles.
2. When they see a cool Intellia Widget on another profile, they can:
   - Click to **copy the widget to their own profile**, or
   - Visit [Intellia Widgets](https://intellia-widgets.vercel.app), copy a widget URL, and **manually paste it** into their profile.
3. Once added, the widget is live and interactive inside their own profile — like a micro-app.
4. All interactions (votes, messages, reviews) are signed transactions and recorded on-chain via the **LUKSO** blockchain.
